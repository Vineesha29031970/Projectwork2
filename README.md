## KIDNEY DISEASE IMAGE SEGMENTATION USING GAN MODEL

## Description

The project utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for precise segmentation of kidney medical images, focusing on CT scans of the kidney. The objective is to automate the detection and classification of abnormalities such as cysts, tumors, and stones, improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing manual workload for radiologists.

## About

Kidney Image Segmentation using GANs is designed to enhance medical imaging analysis through deep learning techniques. Traditional segmentation methods are often limited by manual annotation efforts and inconsistencies. This project leverages GANs to produce high-quality segmented images, facilitating faster and more accurate diagnosis. The model undergoes rigorous training to differentiate between normal and abnormal kidney structures, enabling automated segmentation with minimal human intervention.

## Features

Implements Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for high-precision segmentation.

Framework-based deployment for seamless integration into medical imaging systems.

Scalable and adaptable to different medical imaging datasets.

Optimized processing time for real-time segmentation.

Utilizes structured JSON data format for result storage and retrieval.

## Requirements

Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10, Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.

Development Environment: Python 3.8 or later is necessary for model development and execution.
